It seems like modern php projects have a lot of duplicated needs- test suite configuration, licenses, continuous
integration setup, etc etc. This project is a basic template for all of that with some sane defaults and placeholders
for where things like the project name.

## Installing

### Composer

Installing Spark can be done through a variety of methods, although Composer is
recommended.

Until Spark reaches a stable API with version 1.0 it is recommended that you
review changes before even Minor updates, although bug fixes will always be
backwards compatible.

```
"require": {
  "tedivm/Spark": "0.5.*"
}
```

### Github

Releases of Spark are available on [Github](https://github.com/tedivm/Spark/releases).
